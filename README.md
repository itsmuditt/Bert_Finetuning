# Bert_Finetuning
In this repository, you will find two colab notebooks where, a bert based model will be finetuned on Hindi sentences for classifying whether a sentence is positive, negative or neutral.

In Bert_Finetuning_1, the Bert based model is trained straight away on the dataset. However, in the second file, some layers in the base model are set to non-trainable. This made the model faster and lighter but less accurate.
